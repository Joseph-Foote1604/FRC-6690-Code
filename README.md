# FRC-6690-Code
//Team 6690, MV Robo Pride

So if anyone happens to come back to this on thier own time or if I happen to not be there at the next meeting, this is a link I found to a series of tutroials for Java Programming for Visual Studios. It has everything from setting uo the controller, writing the drive train, all the way to using encoders and ultra sonic sensors. All the videos are less then 10 minutes each yet give lots of insight on how to set up all the programs.
